This is my homework 3 which is like an adventure game. Each button serves a good task usually to update a context object or navigate screens.
We start with add hero which makes a random hero, we can add a hero with a random generator. After a edit hero button allows the leveling of players.
The leveling of players is flawed in that it does not have a way to stop leveling after gold is below 0. 
After we have an adventure screen, the players are able to go through the dungeon and win, no one loses cause they're all winners and because
I didn't know how to use a function without the app telling me "Maximum update depth exceeded". I tried to make a results screens.
Results screen was supposed to have a tenarary operator that either showed the resultswin component if the player won or resultslose comp if player had trouble.

There is more work to be done but time is limited and I have to submit as is. Thank you :)is.
